This repository contains the code and other resources to analyze data for some fictional company's drug research used to treat squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The goal with this project is to help the company pull useful information from these trials in order to determine effectiveness.

After running my analysis code on this data, I noticed 3 things:

1. Of all the drugs measured, the two most effective seemed to be Capomulin and Ramicane. These two drugs had much lower mean and median tumor volumes than any of the other drugs produced, as well as the lowest variance of the data. I believe this would indicate that these drugs merit further testing.

2. There seemed to be a very positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume. Within the mice treated with Capomulin, there was a correlation coeffcient of 0.88 between mouse weight and average tumor volume. It may be worth looking into why this is with such a strong correlation.

3. Overall, I would say the researchers did a good job with their sampling in this study. There was an almost perfect distribution of male to female mice in the study, as well as an equal distribution of mice tested with each drug regimen.
