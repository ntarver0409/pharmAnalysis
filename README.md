This repository contains the code and other resources to analyze data for some fictional companies drug research used to treat squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The goal with this project is to help the company pull useful information from these trials in order to determine effectiveness

After running my analysis code on this data I noticed 3 things:

1. Of all the drugs measured the two most effective seemed to be Capomulin and Ramicane. Those two drugs had much lower mean and median tumor volumes than any of the other drugs produced as well as the lowest variance of the data. I believe this would indicate that these drugs merit further testing.

2. There seemed to be a very positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor voulume. Within the mice treated with Capomulin there was a correlation coefficent of 0.88 between mouse weight and average tumor volume. It maybe worth looking into why this is with such a strong correlation between the two.

3. Overall I would say the researchers did a good job with their sampling in this study. There was an almost perfect distribution of male to female mice in the study, as well a equal distribution of mice to tested on with each drug regimen.
